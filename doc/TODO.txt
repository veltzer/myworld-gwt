funtionality
============
- finish the first form and make it work.
	- add movies that I have already seen (with link to imdb).
	- add datetime selection.
	- add location selection with home as default.
	- add device selection with yes max HD as default.
	- add remark to the view.
	
	- finally do the commit and see that it works (commit pulp fiction two days ago).

build system
============
- get ridd of the ant build warnings and errors.
- get ridd of the password hardcoded in my build.xml file and move it to local (~/something).
- add maven support to fetch the third party jars.
	(I have a link to maven with gwt in my links file).
