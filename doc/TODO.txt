now
===
use gwt native to build a new app.
	try to get to something usable.
	do this using version 2.7.0.
try to use gwt-bootstrap, vaadin or the like (mgwt)
	to enhance the widget set (but only
	if you need it).

environment
===========
- do a bash script that I should source before starting to work on
	this project (instead of having the code in ~/.bashrc).
- make sure that eclipse still works right with all of the recent
	changes.
- configure the app to use only https.
	configure tomcat to only use https (document how to do this).
- store this one on github.
- get this app running on GAE (google app engine).
- get this app running on a remote instance of tomcat.
- do a script that automagically configures tomcat for the needs of this app.
	(python script that adds me as admin of the tomcat with the right user/password,
	that increases the size of maximum upload and more).

functionality
=============
- finish the first form and make it work.
	- add movies that I have already seen (with link to imdb).
	- add datetime selection.
	- add location selection with home as default.
	- add device selection with yes max HD as default.
	- add remark to the view.
	
	- finally do the commit and see that it works (commit pulp fiction two days ago).

build system
============
- ant always rebuilds everything. whats that about?
- get ridd of the ant build warnings and errors.

code
====
- add login to the application with users and passwords.
- get ridd of the password hardcoded in my build.xml file and move it to local (~/.gwtworld).
- get ridd of the password and user hardcoded in src/META-INF/persistence.xml
	and more them to ~/.gwtworld.
